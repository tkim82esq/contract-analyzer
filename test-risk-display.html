                The payment terms require NET 90 payment, meaning you won't
                receive payment for three months after invoicing. For a Service
                Provider, this creates severe cash flow pressure, forcing you to
                fund three months of operational expenses before seeing revenue.
                Industry standard is NET 30, so this triples your working
                capital requirements. If you have multiple clients on similar
                terms, you could face bankruptcy despite profitable contracts.
                Small agencies have failed simply from cash flow timing when
                clients delay payments beyond even these extended terms.

                Negotiate to change payment terms to NET 30 or shorter. Request
                milestone-based payments to improve cash flow. Consider
                requiring partial upfront payment or requesting a retainer to
                reduce cash flow risk.

                The contract states payment is due "upon satisfactory
                completion" without defining what constitutes satisfactory work
                or who determines acceptance. This vague language gives the
                client unlimited discretion to delay or refuse payment based on
                subjective criteria. In consulting projects, such ambiguous
                payment terms have led to disputes where clients withhold
                payment for months, claiming work doesn't meet undefined
                standards. For a service provider operating on tight cash flow,
                this could mean waiting 6+ months for payment on completed work,
                potentially forcing you to pursue expensive legal action to
                collect what you're owed.

        Note: Risk descriptions (50-150 words) focus purely on explaining the
        risk: what the contract says/fails to say, why it harms this party,
        realistic negative scenarios, quantified consequences, and industry
        context. Recommendations are provided separately with specific
        actionable steps.
